# returnees-advice-services
2021 Digital Service Design Project - Group 3: Advice Services for Returnees

This programmed prototype demostrates the basic interaction about:
- navigate from home page to returnee advice services;
- returnee advice services page accordion behaviours;
- input validation of contact form;
- pseudo search page functions and link to the anchor section on returnee advice page with auto-expanded accordion panel;

Note:
- due to the limited time, this version programmed prototype has not successfully addressed the anchor position with offset to the top navigation bar;
- also, the auto-expanded accodion through search only works smoothly on "return-to-finland.html";
- for future iterations, the event needs to be handled considering across pages;
